# ProtonGraph

A node based software for procedural 3D content creation.
By chaining simple nodes together, you can create a complex result.
You can see it as a form of visual scripting, but for 3D models generation.

## Goals

ProtonGraph aims to be easy to use, easy to expand, and centered around game development.
The long term goal is, you can use it to create your content in advance, or embbed ProtonGraph in your
game and generate content on the fly while playing.

Being open source and MIT licenced, ProtonGraph should allow that without legal headaches. We're not
there yet though, and the goal is NOT to replace Houdini or Blender Geometry Nodes.


## Current status

ProtonGraph is a "Godot game" as in, it's made using the Godot engine: you can clone the project and open it with
the Godot editor. It used to be on version 3 and is now being ported to Godot 4. As a result, some features
are currently missing or broken, but the bulk of the port is done already and we're now focusing on stability
and content.

## Roadmap

To track the work in progress and planned features, [head over the project board](https://github.com/orgs/protongraph/projects)

## Build from source
Automated CI actions will be added back soon, in the meantime you can manually build the project like this:

+ Compile or download the latest Godot 4 build.
+ Clone this repository.
+ Open it in Godot 4.
+ From there, you can export the project to your target platform like any Godot project.
